        <h1>Privacy Policy for Parkin</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 27, 2024</p>

        <p>We at Parkin ("we," "us," or "our") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application Parkin - Parking Reminder ("the App").</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or store any personal data on our servers. All data entered into the App, such as parking location, floor, or reminders, is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data and it is never shared with us or any third parties.</p>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The App stores your parking information (such as the location, floor number, and parking duration) only on your device. This data is stored in your device’s local storage (UserDefaults) and is used solely to help you manage your parking sessions.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, we do not share any information with third parties. Your parking data is private and remains on your device at all times.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>As no data is collected or stored outside your device, your privacy is fully protected. We recommend that you secure your device with a password or other forms of protection to ensure your data remains safe.</p>

        <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store any data on our servers, there are no user rights related to accessing, modifying, or deleting data from our servers. All data can be managed directly on your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
